The most useful for this lab are [`CountVectorizer`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer.html)  and [`TfidfVectorizer`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.TfidfVectorizer.html).

    "- max_df: ignore words that occur in more than `max_df` documents (either count or percentage)\n",
    "- stop_words: if set to `\"english\"`, removes common English function words\n",
    "- analyzer, tokenizer, preprocessor, lowercase, strip_accents: controls sklearn's built-in tokenizer. If you want to use your own tokenizer (like the multi-word one we made last week), set `analyzer=identity` and give the vectorizer pre-tokenized texts.\n",

    "`TfidfVectorizer` adds a few additional options:\n",

       "362504    Popular with longhaul cabin and flight crew is always a good sign when the same needs apply to your stop over: dead close to terminals, good 24hr airport shuttle, quiet, good beds, clean, quality international, no-fuss and locally-aware reception staff. Oh, and quality, not rip-off food and bar/s on site. This establishment managed all of the above without any fuss in the 23hrs we spent as a family breaking a ridiculous NY to Brisbane sector. Add a decent gym, a small pool and some touches of unexpected luxury and I can recommend this one unhesitatingly. The lobby bar food particularly was outstanding.\n",

The bed was super comfortable. The room was HUGELY quiet. No LAX noise at all, WOW. The LAX shuttle service was VERY good, the driver helped with my oversized bag, very good service. The restaurant needs more light (could barely read menu) but the service was GREAT and the food was REALLY GOOD.\\ni'm actually a picky person when it comes to hotels, but this one was quite good and i'll be back when in LA. Really happy with this one.\n",

    "I first tried changing max_df to 0.9 to ignore words that occur in 90% of documents instead of 80%. I noticed that this affected the number of documents in each cluster. Initially, cluster 3 had 63 documents, which was the most out of the other clusters. After the change, cluster 7 had the most with 55 documents. Taking a look at the metrics, the scores seemed relatively the same, so the change I made probably wasn't very influential. I tested out different values and found that a value of 0.6 for max_df yielded better scores.\n",
